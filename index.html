						<h4>Origin of Neolttwigi</h4>
						<p>There is no exact data to consider the origin of Neolttwigi, so some say it is presumed to have been handed down since the Goryeo Dynasty, but there is no basis. Considering that the same game as Neolttwigi is a traditional game of native Alaska, it should be said that it originated thousands of years ago from ancient Northeast Asia. There is a record that women during the Goryeo Dynasty performed active sports such as horse riding and Dakyu, so it is presumed that Neolttwigi was also enjoyed by women at the time from the nature of the game.</p>

				<p>In order to play Neolttwigi, a long board and a prop to support are required. The board is made of wood that highly flexible and durable. Usually, it is easier to play with a board where the middle part is thicker than the end, the proper size being 500 - 600 cm x 35 - 40 cm x 5 cm. The prop is a thick object that supports the long board from below to balance it, commonly referred to as goigae. A bundle of straw, or a straw bag of dirt, is typically used as a prop, which has an adequate height of about 30 cm. If a prop is too flat, the ground under both ends of the board may dig into the ground. In this regard, some people dig the ground under the ends of the board, at the very beginning, to be able to jump higher. Also, one person sits on the middle of the board to keep it from moving.</p>
				<p>Once the board achieves balance, the players start to jump. When one person descends to the board after jumping, another person jumps using the rebound force. Two players repetitively exchange these roles to maintain momentum. The maximum height of the jump can be up to about 1.5 - 1.8 m from the lower end of the board.</p>

<p>Neolttwigi is one of the most common and active games for young females at the beginning of January. There is no definitive record about when it began. According to theory, its origin traces back to long ago. One theory suggests that this game was created for women who could not freely go outdoors to get a glimpse of the scenery, and more importantly, men walking the streets beyond the wall. Another theory proposes that this was created for women to take turns looking at the face of their husbands who were imprisoned. This means that two women in the same situation, where their husbands were incarcerated inside a high wall, do Neolttwigi together to try to catch a view of their husbands. Also, there is a theory arguing that people played this game to cast out evil spirits and expel any bad luck on the Gwisinnal (Day of Ghosts, the 16th of the first lunar month). There are also other folk beliefs that an unmarried woman that doesnâ€™t involve herself with Neolttwigi will not be able to bear a child after getting married, or that playing Neolttwigi at the beginning of January will protect the players from having a splinter for an entire year. Likewise, depending on the method of play, Neolttwigi has been transmitted along with new stories.
</p>
				<blockquote>Neolttwigi is a game mainly played by women at the beginning of the year, and it is a game that raises the body in the air, gives strong strength to the legs, and develops a sense of balance of the body. It is believed that Neolttwigi brings body mass and healthy physical beauty. The appearance of women doing Neolttwigi for the New Year is a symbol of life. Usually, women's play is static, while Neolttwigi is a very dynamic form of play. In particular, it has the characteristics of facilitating the metabolism of the body and strengthening physical training in winter. It is also of great significance in promoting friendship and unity between neighbors because it has the nature of an exciting group play in which various folk songs are inserted, and it has been a good means for women from all over the village to gather and have fun together in the new year.</blockquote>
